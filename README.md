# landing-page
The current project that this repo is working on is a basic landing page. The website will have a header, body, and a footer. I'm going to demonstrate how to properly style and arrange a responsive website for desktop based on what I have learned on HTML and CSS. I will also be documenting the progress of this project by using proper commit messages in git.
